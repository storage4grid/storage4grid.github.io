<p class="lead">
S4G engages an <strong>External Stakeholder Group (ESG)</strong> i.e. a group of external, independent experts of recognized knowledge in different kind of background and area of expertise including market, technological trends and standards. The ESG will be constructed properly representing all domains and market roles relevant for the S4G goals, including above all representatives of industries providing storage solutions, but also experts in metering, utilities, international standardization, privacy.
</p>

<p class="lead">
ESG experts are selected and officially appointed by the Storage4Grid Project General Assembly.
To collect ESG recommendations and advises, a minimum of two on-line webinars and two physical meetings will be organized throughout the duration of the project.
The first meetings will be focused on requirement, while latter meetings will be exploited to collect feedback about proposed concepts and generated results.
