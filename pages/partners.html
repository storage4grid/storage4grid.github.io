                <h3>ISMB</h3>
                <h4>Istituto Superiore Mario Boella sulle Tecnologie dell’Informazione e delle Telecomunicazioni</h4>
                <p class="details">
Istituto Superiore Mario Boella (ISMB) is a research & innovation centre operating in the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) domain. Founded in 2000 by Compagnia di San Paolo and Politecnico di Torino, today ISMB relies on technological and process competences of around 150 researchers working in close cooperation with companies, academia and Public Administration. ISMB is organized in Research Areas focused on core sectors of ICT that are capable of managing the whole value chain, from basic technology up to its practical
implementation (proof-of-concept).
				</p>
				<p class="collapse details">
 Since 2010, ISMB has extended its activities to process innovation, orienting its focus on priority themes of the European agenda. Such an evolution aims at employing excellences and results of Research Areas into Strategic Programs that are interdisciplinary by nature. Smart Energy, Smart City and Smart
Health are the strategic programs tackled by ISMB and they represent the first step of a broader action aimed at high-value social projects. The Institute is involved in several industrial cooperation activities with both large enterprises and SMEs, as well as in various higher-education initiatives in partnership with academic institutions.
ISMB will contribute to Storage4Grid (S4G) with skilled and experienced personnel of the Pervasive Technologies (PerT) research area and The Smart Energy Program. The PerT Research Area studies and develops technologies enabling the emerging paradigm of IoT. Pert is organized into three units: IoT Objects and Platforms Unit (in charge of technologies and platforms that turn physical objects in IoT nodes), Pervasive Secure Networks Unit (that studies communication paradigms that ensure flexibility, scalability, security and robustness to communications
among IoT objects) and IoT Service Management Unit (developing distributed and cooperative algorithms at the service level of the IoT). The main function of the Smart Energy program is to support ISMB in new research activities on the use of the ICT applied to the Energy domain. These research activities are carried on through ISMB’s research areas and particular
attention is, at the present, devoted to how ICT may bring new ways of managing energy distribution through smart grids, how to support efficient active demand methodologies, to study user profile loads clustering, algorithms for distributed constrained energy optimization, etc.).
